### Hi there 👋

- 🚀 I'm currently building a quiz app! Exploring random question generation, scoring systems, and user performance tracking for an engaging experience. Stay tuned for updates! 😊 #QuizAppDevelopment.
- 🧠 I'm currently learning everything about African Literature, Psychology, AI, and Finance. I am 📖reading Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence by Anna Lembke & ---Wahala by Nikky May and many others. Time to focus on finishing one book at a time.
- 💻 Ask me about: - .NET Development, Machine Learning 🚀😄.
- 🎨 I see myself as someone with a creative spirit, endeavoring to craft using the tools at my disposal!
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a house cat, upon leaving the house you'd probably find me playing football or basketball or trying to tick something off my bucket list.
- 🎸 Music is the rhythm of my soul: I am currently learning how to play the guitar to strum along to my favourite tunes.
